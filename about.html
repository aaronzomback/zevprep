         I was born in New York and grew up in Montclair, New Jersey. I attended the
University of Pennsylvania, graduating from the history department with honors,
and moved back to New York, where I received an M.A. from The New School
for Social Research. <br> <br>
 Throughout my time navigating the educational landscape, I
received what is considered a rigorous education and pursued the opportunities
most naturally available.  <br> <br> Nevertheless, individual time and attention with
teachers was rare and even when I was able to find some, the time was 
temporary and very focused on the class material at hand. <br> <br> I was rarely
encouraged to broaden my interests, discover passions, and reflect on life and
myself. Certainly the topic of original creative work was never broached. I hope
to offer these possibilities to my students. <br> <br> Typically I root lessons in academic
pursuits, such as SAT preparation and/or class assignments, but the
opportunities I hope to offer my students transcend those narrow concerns. In
doing so I often learn just as much from them. <br> <br> Also though, I am perfectly
content to work solely on standardized test preparation with my students while
acknowledging their whole personhood. Standardized tests test a specific kind of
intelligence that can be highly useful in oneâ€™s personal, educational, and
professional life. And the skills, strategies, and performance required absolutely
build brain power. <br> <br> Keeping a notebook, the execution of daily habits, working on
concentration abilities, maintaining a robust work ethic, and sometimes even
mindfulness practices are all things I stress with my students. <br> <br> In my spare time I
read philosophy and novels translated into English and watch similar films,
though I do enjoy many American films made before 2000 or so. I also meditate,
make short films, write, and stack satoshis.
