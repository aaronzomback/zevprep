            <h2>Test Prep</h2>
            <p>Contrary to popular belief, learning the ACT or SAT, in accordance with individual learning styles, need not remain confined to quantitative measure. Through orthodox and unorthodox methods, students working with me achieve score goals while strengthening, honing, and expanding thinking and learning capacities. Lessons, individualized work outside of lessons, proctored exams, and real contemporary exams, some not widely distributed, typically result in improvements of 100 to 300 on the SAT and 3 to 8 on the ACT.

          <h2>Humanities Tutoring</h2>
          <p>Regardless of reputation and rigor, high schools now rarely cultivate reading and writing interests in students. Through overly burdensome assignments and low curriculum-based expectations, humanities classes rarely challenge students to think and work autonomously and creatively. Whether it’s a history or english assignment or a college essay, the possibilities present for learning vastly exceed those typically imagined. It is in this individualized context that students can intellectually blossom and individuate beyond assignment and curriculum.</p>

          <h2>Mentorship</h2>
          <p>In one-on-one lessons, and sometimes in group meetings, I work with students interested in learning for learning’s sake — in wrestling with self-expression, fictional texts, and the explicitly philosophical. Outside of the institutional and clinical contexts, there are many possibilities for students to grow as individuals. I can offer guidance to students engaged in the trials of adolescence and connect with them as an equal, not in a one-sided fashion. Students often work with me before and after junior year standardized test preparation.</p>

            <p>
              I attended the University of Pennsylvania, graduating from the history department with honors, and moved back to New York, where I studied philosophy at The New School for an M.A. Since this time, for a decade now, I have been working with students in classroom, group, and one-on-one contexts. Most recently, while taking the tests alongside high school students, I scored a 1580 on the SAT and a 35 on the ACT.

              Throughout my time navigating the educational landscape, I received what is considered a rigorous education and pursued the opportunities most naturally available. Nevertheless, individual time and attention with teachers was rare and even when I was able to find some, the time was temporary and very focused on the class material at hand. I was rarely encouraged to broaden my interests, discover passions, and reflect on life and myself. Certainly the topic of original creative work was never broached. Now I hope to offer these possibilities to my students. Keeping a notebook, executing daily habits, developing concentration abilities, and building a robust work ethic are all actions I emphasize.
