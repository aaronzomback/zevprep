            <h2>Test Prep</h2>
            <p>Contrary to popular belief, learning the ACT or SAT need not remain confined to standardized test performance. Through the use of orthodox and unorthodox preparation methods, students working with me typically achieve their score goals while strengthening, honing, and expanding their thinking and learning capacities. Lessons, individualized work outside of lessons, proctored exams, and real contemporary exams, some not widely distributed, typically result under my supervision in score improvements of 100 to 300 points on the SAT and 3 to 8 on the ACT.</p>

          <h2>Humanities Tutoring</h2>
          <p>Regardless of reputation and rigor, high schools now rarely cultivate reading and writing interests in students. Through overly burdensome assignments and low curriculum-based expectations, humanities classes rarely challenge students to think and work autonomously and creatively. Whether it’s a history or english assignment or a college essay, the possibilities present for learning vastly exceed those typically imagined.</p>

          <h2>Mentorship</h2>
          <p>In one-on-one lessons, and sometimes in group meetings, I work with students interested in learning for learning’s sake — in wrestling with self-expression, fictional texts, and the explicitly philosophical. Outside of the institutional and clinical contexts, there are many possibilities for students to grow as individuals. I can offer guidance to students engaged in the trials of adolescence and connect with them as an equal, not in a one-sided fashion.</p>
